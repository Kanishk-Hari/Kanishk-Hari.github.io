### CPSC 120

* Lab 3
    
    Lab 3, part 2 was a lab that I enjoyed because this part of the lab was the first piece of code I felt accomplished writing. 
    Although this lab included simple arithmetic to make the program run correctly, I was still proud of this lab for being one of my most memorable labs. 
    I used the flowcharts and constantly saved and tested my edits to ensure that I would get the correct results from the lab. 
* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was another lab I enjoyed because it incorporated the std::cout and std::cin we were learning about to make a program that converts decimal numbers to inches. 
    Using code such as static_cast intrigued me because I never knew what it did initially, but after many tests, I found out what the purpose of the static_cast was. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was memorable to me because I spent a lot of time in this lab trying to figure out how to make the code function as intended. 
    The problem was that integers include positive or negative numbers, and this program explicitly stated to exclude the negative numbers, but I was unable to get around this problem.
    This caused issues because to find the area of two integers is to multiply them, but if the integers were negative, the area should be 0, and I was confused about this. 
    After many runs of trial and error, figuring out the solution to this lab proved to be fun and simple at the same time.
